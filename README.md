# Take Me to Space

## Game summary

You start in your base camp, close by will be your ol space boots capable of traveling into space, it's your last ditch effort to leave a overridden planet behind. But, you will need to first get the ol boots powered again by defeating the bosses at the end of each dungeon. Once all the parts are acquired to power the boots, they will take you off planet to paradise, although there might be some obstacles in the way once you have left the atmosphere. 

## Technical summary

Take me to Space is a short 2D dungeon crawler that should take around 20 to 30 minutes to beat. It's being developed using [Monogame](https://monogame.net/). My goal with this game is learn core game development mechanics, with more focus on the programming side of it, rather than the art and sounds. Such as collision detection and resolution, UI/UX, scenes/scene switching, inventory management, player input, animation, tilesets, and more. All of these features are self implemented to do my best at understanding and learning what is code is executing in the core gameplay loop. All in all, it will be a short game that should take around 20 to 30 minutes to beat.

## Features already implemented:
- Collision Detection and Resolution
- Primitive Drawing component used mostly for debugging collision polygons
- Camera class
- Tileset reader from JSON data

## Roadmap of features that are a WIP (in order of importance): *art and sounds as needed*
- Player input using command pattern
- Player movement, attacks, and world interaction using a state machine
- Player status bar (health and attacks, weapons?)
- Adding 3 different dungeons with different biomes and a space dungeon for final boss
- Enemies and AI using prototypes through data
- Loot and inventory management
- Pause menu
- Intro and start screen (restart game loop?)
