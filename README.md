# Take Me to Space

Take me to Space is a short 2D dungeon crawler developed using [Monogame](https://monogame.net/). My goal with this game is learn core game development mechanics. Such as collision detection and resolution, UI/UX, scenes/scene switching, inventory management, player input, animation, tilesets, and more. All of these features are self implemented to do my best at understanding and learning what is code is executing in the core gameplay loop. 

## Features:
- Collision Detection and Resolution
- 

## Roadmap:
- Adding 3 different dungeons with different biomes
- 

## Resources and learnings
- [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)
